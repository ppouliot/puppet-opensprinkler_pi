# opensprinkler_pi

This module was developed to configure a RaspberryPi running Raspbian for the
OpenSprinker_Pi hardware board and the associated project software.  Some of
the classes are hardware specific to hardware in my deployment. 

The online user manual for the OpenSprinkler Pi  can be found here:

The module was developed using Puppet 3.6.1.  Puppet and all supporting applications
were repackaged for the raspberrypi using this script.
